## Git Workflow

Our project follows the **Forking Workflow**, which is ideal for open-source projects and encourages contributions from multiple developers.

  1. ### **Workflow Overview:**

	  -	**Fork** the repository.
	  - **Clone** your fork locally.
	  - **Set up remotes** to track origin and upstream.
	  - **Create a feature branch** from main.
	  - **Develop** your feature or fix.
	  - **Commit** your changes following commit guidelines.
	  - **Push** to your fork.
	  - **Create a Pull Request** to the upstream repository.
	  - **Review** your PR.
	  - **Merge** once approved.

---

## How to Contribute

1. ### **Fork the Repository**
   - Click the "Fork" button on the top right corner of this repository to create a copy under your GitHub account.

2. ### **Clone the Fork Locally**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/digicry.git
   cd digicry
```

3. ### **Set Up Remotes**
    - Navigate to the project directory and set up the upstream remote to keep your fork in sync with the original repository:
```bash
    cd digi-cry
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/digi-cry.git
```

4. ### **Create a Feature Branch**
    - Always create a new branch for each feature or bugfix to keep your work organized and to facilitate easier code reviews.
	  - For a feature or enhancement, name your branch like feat/my-feature.
	  - For a bug fix, name your branch like fix/my-bug.
```bash
    git checkout -b feat/my-feature
```

5. ### **Make Changes**
	  - Implement your feature or bug fix.
	  - Write unit tests or integration tests if applicable.
	  - Update any relevant documentation.

6. ### **Test Your Changes**
	  - Ensure the code runs without errors.
	  - Verify all tests pass:
```bash
    npm run lint
    npm run dev
```

7. ### **Commit and Push**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add analytics chart to Home page"
git push origin feat/my-feature
```

8. ### **Open a Pull Request**
	  - Go to your fork on GitHub and click ‚ÄúCompare & pull request.‚Äù
	  - Fill out the PR template with relevant details.
	  - Link to any related issues (‚ÄúFixes #123‚Äù).

9. ### **Keeping Your Fork Up-to-Date:**
    - Regularly synchronize your fork with the upstream repository to minimize merge conflicts.
```bash
# Fetch latest changes from upstream
git fetch upstream

# Checkout your local main branch
git checkout main

# Merge upstream changes into local main
git merge upstream/main

# Push the updated main to your fork
git push origin main
```
